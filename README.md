# IotaPay_v0.0.1
IOTAPay PoC for pay per use

A project for a device which can be installed everywhere where pay per use is needed.

Features:

Think of it like a IOTA connected powerplug where you can buy x seconds of usage time. To use it, check the actual service price per second. Scan the QR Code and send the wanted amount of iota (seconds) to the device. The timer will show the rented time and shortly after confirmation of the payment, the device will switch on whatever (electric) device is connected to it. The timer will show the remaining time. When the timer stops, the connected device will be switched off. A new address and QR Code will be generated and displayed.

Future Features:

For better maintenance, there will be a web interface for the setup of the IOTAPay Device. Another feature is a automatic transaction to the owners wallet in a interval which is free to choose. For the idea of having more than one device the owner can collect all generated funds per day from all his devices automatically.
